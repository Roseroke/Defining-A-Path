Its fundamental function is to determine a course of action that achieves the people's mandate. This could include developing a robust military, ensuring accountability, streamlining agencies, and providing essential domestic services like employment, healthcare, and housing, potentially de-commodifying certain sectors in an age of post-scarcity." }

Government-run agencies would operate as publicly traded businesses, fostering innovation in both public and private sectors. This prevents the affluent from exploiting the system while preserving private enterprise as a seed for innovation." },

This complexity is not inherently bad but becomes a tool for exploitation, maintaining a system where only a select few can navigate and benefit, while the majority remain economically disadvantaged and confused." },

The goal is to create a society that accommodates everyone, rewarding selflessness and punishing exploitation." },

It argues that the system creates apathy and disillusionment among youth. The proposed solution is to have the state take a direct hand in curriculum development, focusing on relevant economics, technology, and skills that guide youth into stable, future-proof industries from a young age." }

The UC is a secure, comprehensive digital catalog of commodities, goods, and services. Citizens earn 'Credits' by performing societally beneficial tasks. This system is designed to provide for basic needs and incentivize productive, community-focused work, reducing the reliance on a purely capitalistic framework. It includes several experimental phases (Alpha, Beta, Omega, etc.) for gradual implementation." },

While the existing structures of the military branches are functionally sound, their culture and motivations require re-evaluation. It also proposes a centralized national police force to handle inter-state crime and improve coordination." }

The document acknowledges the fear of authoritarianism but emphasizes that individual liberties and due process are key to the system's moral and cultural backbone." }
