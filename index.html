                            <p>My name is Roosevelt. I do not believe I come equipped with anything extraordinary that allows me to formulate ideas; I am one of many. I have always felt like I was never taught anything of importance, and that desire for knowledge has led me on a journey to compile a solution and path forward for not just America but all of humanity as new technologies begin to change our perception of work, money, and time. The undertaking of being critical of an entity like the United States in its entirety leaves the undisciplined prone to generalizations. My goal is to shed light on the nuances of American Society and to communicate these ideas in a way that makes sense while instilling the ideal of meaning and purpose. If anything sticks with you, let it be this: The United States Government is not just one person but an entire set of moving parts, people, and institutions working together.</p>
                            <p>In our current system, those willing to engage in acts of selflessness often receive nothing for their good nature and are instead sought out and exploited. This system is dominated by capitalistic concepts where success is relative to one's ability to cultivate a relevant skill, leading to niches in the job market. In my opinion, the numerous "Specialized jobs" amount to nothing but cacophonous busy work made to drown the human "spirit".</p>

                                <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium text-slate-600 mb-2">1.1 Redefining the Role of Government</h4>
                                <p>I define government as an entity in which a population can entrust its wellbeing. A fundamental function of an elected government is to determine its own course to achieve the people's mandate. We operate as a representative democracy, where elected officials are paid to use their powers to make agencies perform pertinent actions for the community. The issue enters with Special Interest Groups, usually partnered with rich corporations or governments, that have an interest in a politician uniquely positioned to financially aid them.</p>

                                <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium text-slate-600 mb-2">1.2 The Mechanics of Exploitation</h4>
                                <p>The ends do not justify the means. To reach a utopian world devoid of hunger and war, those with the vision will, without remorse, exploit the less fortunate. The best way to ensure their continued wealth is to make everyone "the less fortunate". Mankind has long exploited one another to enhance personal wealth. The only difference now is that we have become more clever and cunning, able to use ignorance and obfuscation as a smokescreen.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium text-slate-600 mb-2">1.3 The Primary Tool: Obfuscation</h4>
                                <p>To "obfuscate" is to make something obscure, unclear, or unintelligible. In our society, several "sieves" exist in the job and recruitment sector, strengthened by obfuscation: Etiquette/Adaptability, Culture, Time: Pay Ratio, Social Intelligence/IQ, and Previous Experience. This terminology barrier is evident in fields like finance and law. Complex tax laws and insurance policies use terminology that bars those with less agency from understanding systems that directly impact them. This extends to legislators, who use complex and convoluted wording in laws that can be interpreted loosely to give power to those who already have it.</p>

                                <p>There is a fundamental lack of direction in the United States. The current economic system is untenable. Those who benefited from the post-WWII boom are now in control, leaving the youth with a nonsensical economy manipulated by those with the assets to do so. Those that can make money by making up rules—through hedge funds, trusts, etc.—are "Sophist Thieves," who benefit from the activities of real criminals. The more crime plagues a country, the richer they all grow. The Federal Reserve is purely reactionary, generating policy to either recoup losses or kick the can down the road.</p>

                                <p>The US education system leaves the youth feeling lost or apathetic. Social media has shifted focus to identity and assets over character. Instead of teaching practical skills like economics or taxes, education dilutes the job pool, leaving youth to fall into their socioeconomic place in retail or fast food. Higher education is gated by obscene paywalls, leading to massive debt. My goal is to allocate youth into stable, futuristic industries from a young age to guide their action and drive.</p>

                                <p>This proposal is built on **Collective Servitism**: an ethical shift towards service contribution beyond self-interest as the primary measure of value. The society proposed is one where all participants engage in daily actions to pursue a higher goal: the ascendancy of humanity into a space-faring cosmic race. This process must be equitable for all.</p>

Access to higher-tiered rewards is directly related to this ethic. The goal is to reward good, punish evil, foster love, ostracize hate, incentivize selflessness, and punish exploitation.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">This system is not an all-consuming monolith. The solution is baseline competition. The proposed agencies will operate as government-run, publicly traded businesses. It is not my intention to remove private ownership; rather, the government will compete with private enterprise to incentivize innovation. The goal is to diminish exploitation while strengthening individual liberty, autonomy, and purpose.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">New ideas bring skepticism. The fear is that humans are fundamentally selfish. However, the society I propose is a constitutional democracy where the rule of law is paramount. Due process, individual civil liberties, federal elections, and term limits will remain unchanged in their overall mandate.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">I have concluded that money itself is not the problem. It has become a bastardization of wealth, manifesting as frivolous spending and nepotistic consolidation. Money exists as a vassal through which "Control" can manifest. The problem is fundamental and continues as long as "self and now" is valued above all else. This proposal seeks to define a new path forward.</p>
